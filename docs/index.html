                <h1>In the home - Sofas and Leather Chairs</h1>
                <p>You spent time carefully choosing one of the most expensive items in your home - your sofa, so be proud of it. Most new leather furnishings are not protected from dirt which collects quickly in every day wear. Dirt eventually gets into the grain and if left uncleaned and untreated it will eventually cause the leather to pull apart. We can help.</p>
                <p>To maintain the look and feel, a leather sofa should be cleaned roughly once a year and protection applied to make future cleaning easier. We will deep clean, revitalise and protect it for you, bringing back its natural beauty.</p>
                <p>Understanding the type of leather you have is crucial, so we use a microscope to check, and then we can use the correct products. We provide a really deep down clean and we always supply and apply leather protector for you, completely free, aimed at increasing the life of your sofa. This is much more than leather cleaning as most people know it. </p>
